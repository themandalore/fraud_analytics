This is a repository for our kaggle competition as of now:
https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques 

As of now I've read the datasets in.  
Go to the website and download the train and test set and see if you can read them into a dataframe using the Kaggle.py

Then you can look at Kaggle3.py and it's a basic linear regression output.  I stole a lot of the code from people who have posted it up already, so feel free to do the same to make the model better
